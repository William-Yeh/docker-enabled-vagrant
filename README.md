Docker-enabled Vagrant boxes
============================


## Purpose

Some Linux distributions don't have a pre-installed [Docker](http://www.docker.com) engine. Public Vagrant boxes (e.g., those in [Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search) and [Vagrantbox.es](http://www.vagrantbox.es/)) also lack quality support for Docker. So I build these Vagrant boxes to aid my Docker development.

I also install some handy tools for Docker.


## For the impatient

Use the following public box names (all available from [Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/) service):


- Ubuntu 14.04.x LTS ("Trusty") x64:

  - [`williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker), basically [ubuntu-14.04.4-server-amd64](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/) + Docker

  - [`williamyeh/insecure-registry`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/insecure-registry), basically `williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker` + [Docker Registry 2.x](https://github.com/docker/distribution)

- Debian 8 ("Jessie") x64:

  - [`williamyeh/debian-jessie64-docker`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/debian-jessie64-docker), basically [debian-8.3.0-amd64](http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/release/8.3.0/amd64/) + Docker

  - [`williamyeh/k8s`](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/williamyeh/boxes/k8s), basically `williamyeh/debian-jessie64-docker` + Kubernetes

- CentOS 7 x64:

  - [`williamyeh/centos7-docker`](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/williamyeh/boxes/centos7-docker/), basically [CentOS 7.2](http://mirrors.kernel.org/centos/7.2.1511/) + Docker

- [Docker Registry 2.x](https://github.com/docker/distribution) (only provided in [`williamyeh/insecure-registry`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/insecure-registry) box)

## Build these boxes yourself

Here are steps you can follow to build these boxes on your own.


First, install the [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) tool on your host machine.

Second, pull the [Bento](https://github.com/chef/bento) submodule:

```
# pull the Bento project
git submodule init
git submodule update

# copy Bento stuff to sub-directories
# since Packer doesn't push soft links to Atlas (defects!)...
./copy-bento.sh
```

Third, choose the box directory of your choice:


```
# change working directory to any specific OS;
# for example, "ubuntu-trusty"
cd ubuntu-trusty
```


Now, you can either generate the Vagrant box file *on your machine*:


```
# build `ubuntu-trusty64-docker`:
packer build ubuntu-trusty64-docker.json


# build `ubuntu-trusty64-docker`, VirtualBox version only:
packer build -only=virtualbox-iso  \
       ubuntu-trusty64-docker.json


# build `ubuntu-trusty64-docker`, VirtualBox version only,
# with pre-downloaded ISO file from `file:///Volumes/ISO/`:
packer build -only=virtualbox-iso  \
       -var 'mirror=file:///Volumes/ISO/'  \
       ubuntu-trusty64-docker.json
```

you'll get an 'XXX.box' file in the `builds` directory, if successful.


Or, you can *delegate the building and hosting tasks* to [Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/):

```
# make sure the following environment variables are set:
#   ATLAS_TOKEN
#   ATLAS_USERNAME
packer push ubuntu-trusty64-docker.json
```
